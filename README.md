## Branching Instructions

- **Do not push code directly** to the `main` or `master` branch.  
- Always create a **separate branch** for your work.  
- Once your work is complete, **push to the common branch** (not main/master).  

## Merge Requests

- After pushing your branch, **create a Merge Request (MR)**.  
- Assign the MR to the responsible person for review.  
- This process will help you learn how to properly **raise merge requests** and collaborate.

## Steps to Create a New Branch & Raise a Merge Request
